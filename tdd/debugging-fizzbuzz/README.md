# Debugging in Ruby

Two exercises to practice debugging. 

Each exercise had a number of bugs that I fixed following a systematical approach as described below:

- Tighten the loop (find the exact line the bug is coming from)
- Get visibility (use `p` to inspect everything to help you home in on the exact line)
- Once you know the one thing that is wrong, out of place, misspelled, or not giving you what you expect, try to fix it.

### Exercises goals

- Explain what a bug is
- Explain a good approach to debugging
- Follow an effective debugging process to identify a bug
- Follow an effective debugging process to fix a bug

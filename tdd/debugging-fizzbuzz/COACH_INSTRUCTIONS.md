# Debugging FizzBuzz.

## Intro - 10 minutes

- Introduce the idea of `tightening the loop` and `getting visibility` when debugging.

- Talk about the two types of error they will encounter:
  - Syntax errors, where the code does not run. A helpful error message is generated.
  - Behaviour errors, where the code runs but does not produce the expected output. No error messages are generated, but tests will fail.

- Demonstrate running the tests in `exercise_1`, and using the debugging process to debug a small error in the `fizzbuzz` method.

## Part 1 - 20 minutes

Ask them to use `tighten the loop` and `get visibility` to debug `exercise_1`.

## Mid-point Review - 15 minutes

Gather, and debug fizzbuzz as a group. This is an opportunity for them to see good process in action, and ask questions.

Suggest picking names at random and asking them to solve one error.

## Part 2 - 30 minutes

Ask them to apply the same process to debug `exercise_2`.

## Plenary - 15 minutes

Opportunity for questions.

Do thumbs:

1. Can they explain what is meant by `tighten the loop, get visibility`?

2. Can then use this approach to identify and resolve bugs?

Direct them to the debugging cipher video linked in the README.

# Debugging practice exercise - Card Game

A program that introduces to debugging.

### Exercise goals

- Explain what a bug is
- Explain a good approach to debugging
- Follow an effective debugging process to identify a bug
- Follow an effective debugging process to fix a bug

### Exercise explained

In this program there were a few bugs. THe goal was to find them and fix them, using an approach as systematically as possible:

- Tighten the loop (find the _exact line_ the bug is coming from)
- Get visibility (use `p` to inspect everything to help you home in on the exact line)
- Once you know the _one thing_ that is wrong, out of place, misspelled, or not giving you what you expect, try to fix it.

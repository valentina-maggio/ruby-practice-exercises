# Test-drive a class - Piggy Bank

An exercise to practice and apply the test-driven development process to a simple program.

### Exercise goals

* Explain why we do TDD
* Describe the steps of the test-driven development process
* Apply the test-driven development process to a simple program

### User stories used to build the program

```shell
As a user,
So that I can save money
I can put coins in my piggy bank
```

```shell
As a user,
So that I know whether there are coins in my piggy bank
I can shake it, and it will “cling” if there is money in it
```

```shell
As a user,
So I can enjoy my hard earned savings
I can break my piggy bank and get back the number or coins that I had put in
```
